# BinGo
## A Location-Based Augmented Reality Gamified App to help the environment and save you money.


### Objectives:
The main objective of BinGo is to throw rubbish into bins or even collect the ones that are already down. By doing so, you collect points that you can later redeem in gift cards, tax reduction, transport reduction or even donate to the monthly charity that we support. Tap the camera, scan the rubbish, and throw it in the bin. Recycling it can earn you more points. You may find monsters roaming around in parks. Tap the screen to kill them and earn tree points that you can later use to plant a tree at a specific location and water it to grow.
